By curiosity and with the desire to learn more about container orchestration, I decided to experiment with **Kubernetes**. To do so, I built a small **Spring Boot** application and deployed it on Kubernetes, along with its corresponding database.
This project serves as an initial attempt to explore how Kubernetes works and how to manage containerized applications in a distributed environment.
